                        According to Cambridge Dictionary, space is the empty area outside Earth's atmosphere, where the
                        planets and the stars are.

                        More scientifically, space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely
                        low pressure, where sound doesn't carry because there aren't molecules close enough together to
                        transmit sound between them. Not quite empty, bits of gas, dust and other matter floats around
                        "emptier" areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can host planets, stars and galaxies.

                        We often use space to refer to our reality, to the world we interact with daily, or to the
                        fact that in between everything we see, there is always "something". It could also refer to the
                        distance between two objects or people.

                        More formally this can be defined as the dimension of height, depth, and width, within

                            of music (tonal space, modal space or pitch space).

                            For a lot of people, space is something that reminds them about a long time ago, in a galaxy
                            far, far away... About a time in their childhood or teenager years, when they first got
                            introduced to the stories of the eternal struggle between good and evil, embodied by the
                            Jedi and the Sith using the Force, of epic battles, memorable characters in the likes of
                            Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader or Master Yoda, of weird creatures, iconic spaceships, planets
                            at light years apart and of themes of heroism, redemption, and the balance of power.

                            To others, space is about seeking the unknown and the promise and possibility of discovery.
                            They imagine a future just like in <i>Star Trek</i>, where the Enterprise and its crew embark on
                            missions of exploration and diplomacy. It's a saga about daring captains, the unity of a
                            diverse crew working together, about strange alien species, uncharted planets, and the
                            vision of a future where humanity thrives through curiosity, understanding, and a hope for
                            a better tomorrow.

                            And some may have a pessimistic look on what space could mean, possibly influenced by the
                            reality portrayed in <i>Interstellar</i>. They imagine a future where humanity will be in
                            a desperate search for survival among the stars, of navigation through wormholes, planets
                            where the hours are different, and the relentless pull of black holes. The human spirit will
                            be tested by time, love, and sacrifice which can be overcome only through hope, resilience,
                            and the unbreakable human will to endure.

                        I discovered this <a href="https://youtu.be/0wJtzSi59UQ?si=JjJt1FRrsNpCEdkQ">video</a> some
                        time ago, and it made me think about our relationship with outer space, how we have this innate
                        curiosity about what's beyond the Earth's atmosphere, how we look up at the night sky and are
                        left in awe by the beauty in front of us, how we named the stars and the planets because we
                        understood their importance, and how we dream about someday reaching them.
                    </p>

                        It is quite well known that remnants of the Big Bang make up the chemistry of everything around
                        us, from Earth to our own bodies, and maybe it is why we have such a fascination towards space,
                        as it is essentially the birthplace of our existence.
